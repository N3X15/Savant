Savant
======

[Savant](http://phpsavant.com) is a simple PHP-based templating system that uses PHP itself as the templating language.  There is also no need to compile templates, although the capacity for adding a compiler to Savant exists.

Purpose of this Repository
--------------------------

Unfortunately, it appears that Savant has been abandoned, and it has not aged well.  In this repository, I will attempt to improve it for my own purposes.  You are free to use it as you please, and issues and pulls are welcomed.

Savant will be used in the next generation of Kusaba, a popular imageboard system.

I will also work on improving documentation for Savant, since it's fairly sparse, at the moment.

Important Notes
---------------

* No guarantees regarding compatibility with mainline Savant 3.0.1 are made.
